# Block Blast

A lightweight Tetris clone built with vanilla JavaScript. Pieces fall automatically on a 20x10 grid and can be moved or rotated with the keyboard. Clear full rows to score points. The game now supports pause/resume, simple sound effects and automatically saves/restores your game state using `localStorage`.

Controls:
- **Arrow Left/Right** – move piece
- **Arrow Up** – rotate piece
- **Arrow Down** – soft drop
- **Space** – hard drop
- **P** – pause/resume

## Development
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play. The game tracks score, best score and current game state in `localStorage`.
