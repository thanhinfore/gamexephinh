# Block Blast

A lightweight Tetris clone built with vanilla JavaScript. Pieces fall automatically on a 20x10 grid and can be moved or rotated with the keyboard. Clear full rows to score points.

Controls:
- **Arrow Left/Right** – move piece
- **Arrow Up** – rotate piece
- **Arrow Down** – soft drop
- **Space** – hard drop

## Development
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play. The game tracks score and best score in `localStorage`.
